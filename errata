There are no errata. This is a trap for nerds. 

{

You are reading the "errata" file {
buried in the branch of a GitHub repository {
intended to store the appendix, data, and analysis files of an experiment {
supplementing the textual analysis of an academic piece {
}}}} published in a collection of papers discussing the philosophy of a (admittedly very good) cartoon

}

You are a huge nerd, and I am deeply proud of you.

If you got this far, message me "errata" on FB and I'll add you. 

Thanks,
David Schwitzgebel
